    <h1 class='album-title'> Everyone You Love Will Be Happy Soon
    </h1>
    <h2 class='song-title'>A Nation of Two</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> I made an expedition through a country that's not my own, crossed the mountains and swam
        the river, and found I was still alone. And I came across the desert trying to make life a metaphor, but there
        was no one there to share my wisdom with, so I moved along.
    </p>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> I thought, "If you really want to love somebody, it will cost you more than you have. I can
        guarantee you that."
    </p>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> So I turned to education, and sought understanding of human kind. Stood on the shoulders of
        prudent giants, just
        trying to glimpse the light. But the shadow is overwhelming, it buries good men beneath the sand, so I reached
        out
        for a savior and I found her hand.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> If you really want to love somebody, it will cost you more than you have. I can guarantee
        you that it's worth every
        bit. I can guarantee you that!
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> I can guarantee that there's nothing in this life that has ever felt so right. And there's
        nothing in this world
        except you and me. And there's no one in this life quite like the two of us. And there's no one in this world
        quite
        like the two of us.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> It's Better To Spend Money Like There's No Tomorrow Than Spend Tonight Like There's No
        Money
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Take what you need but you better need all you take, because there's fire in the mountain,
        there's a ghost in the
        lake. So when the devil comes calling, you'd better send him away, son.

        Get your ambitions all squared in your head, when you start feeling anxious you get out of your bed, because if
        your heart's full of dancing, you'd better dance til you're dead.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> You better stop and smell the roses. You better love the life you live, and you'd better
        take note of when it's
        killing you, because we all end up at the cemetery.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> So make way for the modern Adonis in me, as he screams to the clouds, "Oh when will I be
        complete?!?" But he can't
        stomach pity; he coughs it up on your sleeve. So get to the city as fast as you can and find you a good woman
        to
        hold your dirty hands, because all the whores that you've had; they'll never make you a man.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Our Sun Is Always Rising</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Well, I'll hold my breath when I take your hand to try and make the moment expand and wrap
        my head around the epic
        truth, that there is nothing I can do, I'll always be in love with you.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Though they say a man must be an island, it didn't take me long to realize that, my lady,
        you are like the ocean
        and the obvious is true, there is no me if there's no you.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Lord, I'm on borrowed time (the story of my life). Yeah, we're gonna make it work. Yeah,
        we're gonna make it last
        for a while.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> I know it happens all the time but it's our thing that we're doing. Just like the sun is
        going to rise up, our love
        keeps it moving.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Seal My Fate</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Seal my fate with a photograph, that our kids will look back on and laugh and they won't
        believe that we ever were
        young. But right now I've got bags underneath my eyes, and it looks like they mean to stay this time because
        I've
        been tired since the second that I woke up.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> I'm so out of it, but I know that I'll get used to it, because everybody does.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> So come on, come on! The sun is up now, and we want it all.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Lately I've been so terrified of everything that I plan to try, and as I carve my name deep
        into the earth I wonder
        why I do all the things I do when I just want to hang around with you. I can hold you up and I won't let you
        down.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> The Beginning of Everything at the End of the World</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> I am part of this social idea that there should be even ground for the oil man and trash
        man.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And we would be content. There will be food on the table and we will love our neighbors.
        Yeah, we will trust our

        neighbors.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> It's a point of view with few contradictions that everyone I know is some sort of
        politician with all our bleeding
        hearts, with all our good intentions. It never makes a difference. Well, it rarely makes a difference.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Oh Lord, I love you so, but you've been misrepresented. Although, your flock does grow
        under these false pretenses.
        It leaves me feeling cold. It leaves me feeling faithless because our scars both new and old, they never seem
        to
        shame us.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Red & Gold</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> By morning time, the sunlight will unfold and turn everything below it red and gold.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And maybe I won't wake up feeling so old. By evening time, sky's all blue and cold.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Time don't matter now. I'm on my way out.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Take your time discussing all your needs, because every road will end up at the sea.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> So you can spend your days on your hands and knees, by evening time, I hope you've found
        some peace.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> My New Year's Resolution Is To Cope With My Mortality
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Salute my sisters; salute my brothers, out on the front line for the politics of others.
        Lord, bring them home
        (with their ammunitions full). Lord, bring them home.

        Because when it's over, I'm not looking for rebirth. Just dress my bones up and lay them in the earth. I need
        the
        rest. Oh lord, I need the rest.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And I'm just waiting for the bells to start a' tolling, across the river where the water's
        overflowing.

        Maybe the angels need to carry me in, kicking and screaming and clinging to my skin.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And maybe life is like the autumn trees, and I'm just one of many very mortal leaves. Just
        praying to the fates
        that we survive the freeze.

        But there's at least a hundred reasons why I should go to heaven when I die, so I'll just sit and patiently
        await
        my time.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Oh, I can hear it, the song of huddled masses, singing and yearning for better social
        classes. I don't know
        anything about it so I let it go.

        Because when it's over I'm not looking for rebirth. Just dress my bones up and lay them in the earth. I need
        the
        rest. Oh lord, I need the rest.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Because no one really can explain the rest; what's gonna happen to us after death. Can it
        really be the same for
        everybody? And no one really can predict the rest; what's gonna happen to us after death. Can it really be the
        same
        for everybody?
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Congratulations, Seth & Kara
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Sit me down and say you're having a baby. You caught me off of my guard. Like the time you
        smashed my thumb with a
        hammer and then Dad came running through the yard.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> But you were so kind even though none of your friends ever were.

        You had faith that even I could one day be made whole and I know it's a pain how I can act like I know
        everything.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> But you carried me up, when the mountains were steep, and you kept me afloat when the
        waters were deep.

        So I'll do what I can to be the brother you need. Thank you, Seth, for being a brother to me.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> You and I could read the scriptures daily and we'd still probably never agree. You say
        Joshua was a mighty leader,
        well, he's still an asshole to me.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And our lives, they keep us all apart til the holidays. So I've come to realize that having
        such a tender heart,
        it's a curse as much as it's a blessing, right? Am I right?
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Golden (Like the State)
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> The second that you came around, I knew that we would work because we were golden (like
        southern California).

        All my life, I've waited for a love that could not be ignored in good conscience, a love I could ascend to. So
        let's never let our day jobs get us down.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Sometimes we stay in bed as long as our schedules will allow it, and I don't really see the
        problem with it.

        Throw your hands up and throw all your inhibitions out. I don't really see the problem with it. Just stay cool.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>
        I've been working hard, you see. I dirtied my hands on the necks of old identities, all the things I used to
        be.
        Because love is like the angry sea and I've been drowned and baptized (it's the same to me, when they pull you
        underneath).
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Sometimes we stay in bed as long as our schedules will allow it, and I don't really see the
        problem with it.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> My heart exploded and now it's like there's love and blood all over the floor.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Because the days can feel so long, when you're out there on your own. But pretty soon I'll
        be coming home, so just
        try and do your best to stay cool.

    </p>

    <h2 class='song-title'> Well, The Truth Is...
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> We are cool and cold, we have everything we could need or want, and we want everything.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And we don't care if we're cold.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> We are old and new, we have been refined. We have held our tongues for the longest time. We
        are cold.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> When the sun burns out I will light myself, and show everyone how bright I burn.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> So hit them with everything that you have. Let them all go tumbling, tumbling. Oh, I always
        knew that you were
        something else. When will you turn around?
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> The truth is that everybody that I love may or may not be happy soon but I wouldn't waste
        my time on loving someone
        else, if you don't love yourself.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> On Husbands and Wives
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> I'm tired but I won't be sleeping. Stay in with me for the evening. We are something I
        believe in. Now, if I can
        just never let you down. I can hear our wedding bells ringing almost a year after the thing. I still hear the
        stereo playing loud, "Oh, Yoko" as we walked out.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> And when you're holding me tight, we both realize that we are just getting warmed up. Here,
        it's just me and you,
        our nation of two. Because love is less what you say and more what you do and who you spend the rest of your
        life
        with. I'm gonna spend mine with you.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Oh, lover, hear me call when I'm drowning in the 9 to 5 of this town. We're all just
        working to live but only you
        can comfort me.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> How to Fake Like You Are Nice and Caring
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Well, hear me out. Everybody's young once. And we throw our hopes around, they never mean
        much. I wasn't thinking!
        My power was so powerful and new. So I'll chalk this up to all the stupid things that I've done, and all the
        stupid
        things that I'll do.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Do you lie awake, and worry about the future? Because you're just as safe as you ever were.
        We're running out of
        time. We're marching on but we are not alive.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> I'll see you at the top of the mountain, waiting for the flood to change us.

        I wish you'd climb down off your cross and burn it. If it's not doing any good then we could use the wood that
        it
        provides us. (That you denied us.)
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Wash those dirty hands! What if the lord decides to let us go?!?
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Is it such a sin to want to save our skin from the mess we've made...that we made in faith?
        Or was it arrogance?
        Oh, what's the difference? Can anybody tell the sick from the well? If you're throwing in with these greedy men
        that pull all the strings and ruin everything... Well, who wants to live forever in these dying lands with
        these
        dirty hands?
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> On Modern Men
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> So lift your hands up from your sides, rinse them both off with your pride, and let the
        world see what we're not.
        Because we have carved out our desires, and placed them in the hands of liars that will forget you when they
        want.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> They want you to take a bow. Everybody here's allowed one. So make it good, son.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>
        And let there be no sacred lands. With one final song and dance, let our clean hands know the earth. We'll
        build a
        culture, brave and strong, we won't rely on anyone, and all our souls will know their worth.
    </p>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Pave the way, we are modern men, and we have fought to exist. We have crawled from the
        water to the dry land, and
        our hands are the dirtiest.
    </p>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> But I'm alive and the sun is shining in! Oh, I have fought to exist. I have crawled from
        the water to the dry land,
        and my hands are the dirtiest.

        I'm alive and the sun is shining in! Oh, my belly has been filled. I have seen everything a body can see, and
        my
        hands are the dirtiest.
    </p>




    <h2 class='song-title'> Congratulations, April & Lucas
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> I'm gonna count my blessings. I'm gonna count my sacred things, like the baby I caught
        smiling at me, or how my
        lady loves me effortlessly. Oh, there must be a god, somewhere in the universe. May be looking after me. Yeah,
        he
        may be smiling down on me. Hallelujah.
    </p>
