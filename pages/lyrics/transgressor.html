    <h1 class="album-title">TRANSGRESSOR (2015)</h1>
    <h2 class="song-title">Seven Hells</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>Did you forget yourself? Get yourself into it?
        Thought you might have had a chance and blew it?
        I shouldn’t have to be the one to tell you this…
        But if you’re pinning all your hopes on another,
        why not bite the curb, leave your brains in the gutter?
        Well, I ain’t ever one to judge you, brother,
        I tend to like my mind in the gutter too.

        Seven hells to hold you, old Transgressor’s coming out.
        So make peace with all your demons when you just don’t have the strength to cast ’em out.

        I’ve got a problem and I can’t seem to fix it.
        Midas touch of turning things to shit
        I’m trying to learn to keep my curses to myself.
        But now everyone I love has figured out what I do.
        And so everyone I love is living out the same awful truth.

        Hope, I tried to catch you with my broken fingers…
        Hope, I tried to plant you in my garden so you’d grow
        Then I wondered why you didn’t flourish, now I know…
        Transgressor crushes all the things he can’t let go.

        Darlin’, let me hold you, we’ll remember why we stay.
        I’ll memorize the cadence of every word you say.
        And gather up the dark clouds, line ‘em up and make ‘em sing
        of all the better days that their subtle silver linings are bound to bring.</p>



    <h2 class="song-title">The Most Dangerous Game</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">Stick your hands up, let 'em down.
        Don’t we all feel so much smarter having played a part in this.
        It’s a nice hat, it’s a crown.
        Out of all the hats I wear it’s easily the heaviest.

        I know that everything I build here will burn
        Once you understand the problem you can learn how to be part of
        it’s a lesson I’m unlikely to learn.
        Now my veins are full of rust and it’s worse than I thought.

        Keep it pent up, let it out.
        I used to have opinions too, still probably have more than you do.
        But if it’s free I like it less, but if it costs me flesh I like it best!
        You want regrets? I’ve got a few.

        I know that everything I build here will burn
        But once you understand the problem you can learn how to be part of
        it’s a lesson I’m unlikely to learn.
        Now my veins are full of rust and it’s worse than we thought.

        Oh I have been so afraid, down and out and planned to stay
        in the gutter with my name just staring at the sun.
        Count my blessings, what a waste, oh I have just begun to play.

        Keep your hands up, what a show!
        Don’t we all feel so much stronger
        Having dealt a part of some extravagantly brutal crushing blow

        I know that everything I build here will burn
        Once you understand the problem you can learn how to be part of
        it’s a lesson I’m unlikely to learn.
        Now my veins are full of rust and it’s worse than I thought.

        Now my heart is pumping dust but my body won’t stop.
        My body won’t stop
    </p>


    <h2 class='song-title'>MOTHER OF A DEAL</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>Come a little closer tell me what you need it’s a mother of a deal
        Got a pocket full of power, a promise up my sleeve and I know just how you feel
        So gimme your hand, let me take you to the river, no one is around
        Do you wanna see a trick, I can walk on water, I can show you how
        But when I do, you gotta promise that you won’t go runnin’ for the hills,
        So do you wanna know?

        When I’m drowning in blood I keep swinging. When I’m down in the mud I keep singing
        And I’m starting to feel so much better
        This is how you play the game

        I am the patron saint of making bad decisions, it’s been long enough to know
        I got a penchant for the masochistic, prefer the taste of the pessimistic.
        And I don’t think I’m ever gonna be the kinda man I wanted me to be
        But I can scrap with the best of ‘em yeah, I can out bleed the rest of ‘em
        And when I do, I really do I really do I really do
        so I think I wanna go home
        Yeah I do, yeah I do, I really do I really do
        I think I wanna go home

        When I’m drowning in blood I keep swinging.
        With my hands full of mud, I keep slinging it.
        I’m starting to feel so much better
        This is how we play the game

        Sunken eyes don’t radiate
        The way they did in Ninety Eight
        These tired songs don’t resonate
        They never did much anyway
        still, I feel them in my bones
        and I thought that you might like to know that I still function

        Sell yourself
        Everything is gonna be much better now
        Sell yourself
        Everything you build could be much bigger now
        So ring those bells
        Just another pound of flesh might do it
        Just sell yourself
        Sell! Sell! Sell!

    </p>

    <h2 class='song-title'>THE ROAD TO PERDITION</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'>

        I looked across the room and saw a face shining in the dark
        like a lighthouse, warning weary sailors of the rocks below,

        And telling stories bigger than the Iliad or Odyssey.
        I’ve got a feeling you’re my alpha and omega and my in between.

        Yes I do really think that I could like you
        Yeah, it’s true, that you don’t know me but I’d like you to spend some time
        'cause I can’t get you off my mind

        I heard that you’re a jew, is it a problem I’m a christian?
        well I don’t give a damn, I’ve got a habit of abandoning traditions.
        'cause I like the way you laugh, that I seem to make it happen,
        if you want to know the truth, it was something that I needed.
        I have been so depressed.

        Yes I do really think that I could like you
        Yeah, it’s true, that you don’t know me but I’d like you to spend some time
        'cause I can’t get you off my mind
    </p>


    <h2 class='song-title'>UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'>

        So I think by now I understand the problem
        That this was not at all the life you wanted
        If I’m not around, then how could I be any version of the man you need

        You’re a single mom
        And I’m always gone.

        When I say I’m alone, I’m alone
        (Screaming at the top of my lungs
        Screaming at the top of my lungs)
        I mean to say that, “We’re alone, we’re all alone”

        Let me hear you sing it in a whisper
        Let me know which words will draw you closer
        I won’t make a sound if you don’t wanna
        I’m just feeling old so if I let you down,
        or when I let you down, could I be forgiven

        So I tell myself I’ll be home before the morning
        When I can right the wrongs my absence has been causing
        I’ll be strong and kind. I will follow through.
        I’ll do everything that she asked me to,
        I will neutralize
        I equalize

        I'll be screaming at the top of my lungs
        screaming at the top of my lungs

        I’m so tired of practicing on stages.
        Every empty bar a bad decision that I’m making.
        I wish I was someone else,
        I wish that you loved someone else.

    </p>

    <h2 class='song-title'> KINDNESS</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Open up the cloud, let the flood come down and wash the earth. Carry all the dust and the
        dirt and the ash of what
        we were. And the wolves only come at night, but darlin’, you and I, we were made for the light. Open up the
        clouds,
        let the flood come down on me.

        And I’ll say with all the confidence I have, if your feet are getting tired I can take you on my back, and we
        will
        carry one another as we march into the sun, saying darlin’ I will never get enough of your kindness, of your
        laughter, of your love.

        I can hear the trees as they bend in the breeze and they call our names. Calling us forth, we were born from
        the
        earth in a golden age. And I walked all across this land looking for a love I could understand, looking for a
        price
        that a soul could pay and a blessed plot of land where our bodies lay with a stone put above our heads, it'll
        mark
        our place.

        Say that we will always be this way: always moving, always shaking, always building, always breaking. I'm gonna
        love you ‘til the grave: I’ll make songs of all the things we said, build a monument in the place we met, teach
        the
        cynics what it means to be in love.
    </p>


    <h2 class='song-title'> I HEARD THE DEVIL SAY MY NAME
    </h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'> Call it what you want. Is it a golden age, or just everybody seeing what they want?
        Oh, it’s hard to say. Yeah I was thinking maybe I was born to be a smaller flame.
        Might light the path of fewer men but keeps the fear at bay.
        Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid.

        I once had my hands on a heart that beat, with every breath I’d breathe, so consistently.
        Now I have got my hands on a heart that bleeds, I got a heart that leaks, so uncontrollably

        I know you’re probably tired of all the jokes I tell. I know you’ve heard ’em all a million
        times, and they don’t age well. If you wanna know the truth, sometimes I tire of them
        myself. If you wanna know the truth, I fear I dried the well when I could not be someone
        else. And now to pay for all my sins, I’ll never make you laugh again.

        I’m begging you to know me, I’m begging you to figure me out.
        Are you brave enough to love me? Are you smart enough to have your doubts?
        I’m begging you to know me, but I’m always wishing I was someone else.
        Can you make an honest man of the kind of liar that deludes himself?
        I’m begging you to know me, I’m begging you to figure me out.
        And when the panic motivates me, are you strong enough to hold me down?
        Are you strong enough to hold me down?

        Because I heard the devil say my name out loud, and now he’s never gonna let me out.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title"> A YEAR IN DECLINE</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics"> I guess I should be a little stronger than I am, a little stronger like I promised I’d
        be, now I know what doesn’t kill you makes you weak.
        And I wish I could be a little smarter than I am, a little quicker than I was the last time,
        now it seems the ground is frozen to my feet.

        I could make this work, I can make this happen, if I wanted to...If I wanted to.
        I can make this work, I can make it happen, if I wanted to...If I wanted to.

        I can’t sleep, if you’re not laying next to me...

        Sing a sweeter song. Sing a song of love and faith, sing a song of courage and devotion,
        sing it 'til we all remember how it feels.
        Celebration songs are filling up our houses, I will love the earth again, I will
        know my name again, I will find my place again.

        And I could make this work, I can make this happen, if I wanted to...If I wanted to.
        I could wake this up, my little sleeping dragon, If I wanted to…if I wanted to..

        But I can’t sleep, if you’re not laying next to me.
        It’s incomplete. There’s plenty quiet, never peace.
        So sing it out! Like angels perched on steady shoulders.
        And cast them down! Those devils of our lesser natures.
    </p>



    <h2 class='song-title'> WHEREVER YOU TAKE ME</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Remember when I lived in Tennessee
        And you came to visit slept next to me
        We shared a wooden bed not meant for two
        And I told you I loved you and I still do

        But I’m tired of talking let’s go to bed
        Cause I just need to get out of my head
        I been trying to keep our burdens light
        I just wasn’t made for these times

        I‘ll stay as long as long as you will have me
        And I’ll follow if you want to lead
        And I’ll share the load that gets so heavy
        Wherever you take me, home I will be

        I think that maybe I lost myself
        On a year of trying to be someone else
        Now I'm scared and sad and feeling stuck
        but I ain't ever gonna give you up

        Wherever you take me, home I will be

    </p>

    <h2 class='song-title'> THE VIRGIN'S APARTMENT</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>
        It was the summer
        when I met my lover
        We were much younger
        I guess we all were

        I knew then
        Like I know now
        That our lives would be
        Intertwined somehow

        It was the only thing I knew
        She would be my hope my truth

        Curse the skin that we were born in
        Shrug it off
        We will set the world on fire
        and watch it burn
        All I need is time and patience oh my love
        We will make these four walls sacred
        Parthenon Parthenon Oh Parthenon

        All I need is time and patience oh my love
        We will make these four walls sacred
        Parthenon
        Curse the skin that we were born in
        Shrug it off
        We will set the world on fire
        Watch it burn
        Watch it burn
        Watch it burn

        I all I need is time and patience
        We will make these four walls sacred
        Parthenon Parthenon Oh Parthenon
    </p>


    <h2 class='song-title'> MIDNIGHT AT THE DAIRY PALACE</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> Crowd's thinning out, our friends are going home, and I’d love if you’d be the one
        to make a move, but I know you won’t. There’s something you do, does something to me….
        I made up my mind, when I saw you there. If I get a chance I will whisper the truth where no one can hear.
        'Cause
        there's something you do, that does something to me. For once in my life, I know what I want.

        And I’m tired of waiting for you to finally see. At the end of the day, 'til the end of
        our days, you belong with me.
        I lost all the blood in my head to my heart, and I'd give up anything else that I want, in spite of the friends
        that don't see what we've got, you came to me.

        I’m tired of waiting for you to finally see. At the end of the day, 'til the end of
        our days, you belong with me.


    </p>
    <h2 class='song-title'> ALONE IN THE DARK (Vinyl version bonus track)</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> You and me at the rocket park, you and me at the El Lugar, you and me at the Opry Land, and
        you and me reaching out
        our hands

        Alone in the dark
        Stay!

        All our friends got the cynic's touch. All our friends think they know so much. None of them ever been in love,
        so
        all our friends they can all get fucked.

        Alone in the dark
        Stay!

        Sing a love song with the words wrong, make it last a while. I'll take the blue skies with the black nights.
        It's
        you and me all year long, and I think that we belong.

        Driving fast better get there soon. It's you and me at the ICU. One of us is going home alone, and one of us
        into
        the unknown. Well I don't want to go. I don't want to go.


    </p>
    <h2 class='song-title'> You Are Destroyer (Vinyl version bonus track)YOU ARE DESTROYER (Vinyl version bonus track)</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'> You’ve had a long kind of year, had the wrong kind of year, you’re finally tired
        enough to know fear, and you pretend to have some kind of hope, but you know
        that you don’t. You’re just beating a horse that can’t run.

        You should be thankful now. You should be thankful.

        You really thought you would be showing up on TV. Changing lives every time that you speak.
        Do you believe every lie that you tell, can you live with yourself?
        You are destroyer of all that you love.

        You should be thankful now. You should be thankful.

        If you learned your lesson and escaped with your life,
        If you were selfish and petty but you’ve still got your wife.

        You should be thankful now. You should be thankful.

        If you found the bottom of a bottomless well, but you can still feel the sunlight and you can still hear the
        bells.
        So if songs still mend broken hearts, and carry their weight to the top. If you've still got some air in your
        lungs, and you can sing with your mouth full of blood, 'cause you never know when to give up. You never know
        when
        to give up.</p>
