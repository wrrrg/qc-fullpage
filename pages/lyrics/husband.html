    <h2 class='song-title'>ON EX-HUSBANDS & WIVES</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>This is weird, don't you think? How I used to have a wife, now I've only got a roommate?
        Weird, don't you think?
        How we
        used to hang so tightly, now we just can't come together on anything? How I never thought I'd run from you, but
        I've
        been living in the other room?
        <br><br>
        This is weird, don't you think? How you used to have a husband, now there's just a fucking ghost in the halls?
        And
        he's
        trapped inside the house, yeah, he's tethered to the memories of love between these walls...and I think he's
        gonna
        linger, at least until the summer or the fall...and I think that he'll probably never really be free again...
        <br><br>
        But time is on our side...Time is on our side...I guess.
        If you can keep it together, just keep it together, you're fine...
        If you can keep it together, just keep it together, you're fine...
        because one way or another, for better or worse, this too is gonna pass...
    </p>

    <h2 class='song-title'>OH THE HUMANITY!</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>
        At 17, I bet that I was such a handsome thing. I bet that you could see the optimism dripping off of me, but I
        suppose,
        this is how it always had to go. The clouds were rolling in, the sky was graying quickly...

        But I grit my teeth and I beat my chest in the greedy face of the ugliness and I pushed it down where I could
        not
        feel
        it, then I kept my cool, because my cool concealed it...
        <br><br>
        But I know, I can't let it go, I've been here too long. Maybe I'm the one that changed but if so, I want the
        devil
        I
        know, not some angel I don't.
        If it seems like they're all singing along but they're doing it wrong, you're doing it wrong. I can feel it in
        the
        air!
        Now something tells me, we've been here before...
        <br><br>
        At 21, I was basking in the warming sun. I fell in love with the idea that life had meaning to it. So imagine
        my
        surprise when I did realize that everybody here was just coincidental...

        You take your love, put it on your shelf, while you're moving units for someone else, til you see dead eyes in
        the
        mirror's face. It's a fucked up time, in a fucked up place.
        <br><br>
        But I know, I can't let it go, I've been here too long. Maybe I'm the one that changed but if so, I want the
        devil
        I
        know, not some angel I don't.
        If it seems like they're all singing along but they're doing it wrong, you're doing it wrong. I can feel it in
        the
        air!
        <br><br>
        Now something tells me, we've been here...something whispers in my ear... as I feel my eyes growing tired and
        blind,
        won't you calm me down,can you calm me down?! Because my bones and spirit bend and break but I never thought
        that
        they
        would...
        <br><br>
        Now I'm 33, and all that's left for me is greed, spite, and jealousy. Oh, the humanity!

    </p>
    <h2 class='song-title'>AN UNHOLY YEAR</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'>I'm a cliche but when we get back to my place, we both know what it is we both want. I've
        been thrusting my way
        through
        this city for one whole unholy year, what's one more?!
        <br><br>
        When we're done I will get back to being rational. I'll be lying next to her feeling miserable, and only when
        she's
        gone will I be comfortable. Is alone the only way I can be comfortable?!? For a moment, I am happy to believe
        in
        this
        poor imitation of the thing I needed. I've been waiting on something to change me. I've been waiting on
        something
        to
        change.
        <br><br>
        Here's the part where I start to freak out: I wonder if they hear us having sex in the next room. But either
        way,
        it's
        fine. We still take our time, and then I halfway hope she goes home...
        <br><br></p>

    <h2 class='song-title'>WE SHOULD GO TO COUNSELING</h2>

    <p class='song-lyrics'>
        Just put your back into it, just wrap your head around the ugliness. What can be said about it? What can be
        said
        for
        such an ugly mess? You've got to change, change, change, mother fucker! You cannot stay the same, same, same,
        expecting
        progress! You've gotta do the work, work, work, and if you want it, you've got to let it hurt, hurt, hurt,
        until
        you're
        smarter!
        <br><br>
        I never learn, you've got to teach it to me softly...
        True to form, you've got to teach it to me softly...
        <br><br>
        If you put your heart into it, you think it ain't your fault it doesn't work (but it is, yes, it is!)
        What can be done about it? What can be done except to let it hurt (because it is what it is!)
        What can we really claim to know from dedication? The tree remembers, the axe forgets! I don't know much about
        it,
        I
        don't know much about you anymore...
        <br><br>
        I never learn, you've got to teach it to me softly...
        True to form, you've got to teach it to me softly...
        Let's say we never saw it there, just growing in the bitter air. Now I'll pretend like I don't care. Let's say
        we
        never
        saw it there..
        <br><br>

        Tell me how it's gonna be. The future's looking bleak to me...

    </p>
    <h2 class='song-title'>ON GUILTY PLEASURES</h2>
    <p class='song-lyrics'>So I guess I finally know what shame is all about, but I won't repent because I've got
        nothing I can stand to say
        out
        loud. It's a part of me that I could live without but I want what I want so now the only thing that's left to
        do
        is..
        <br><br>
        Count the cost of all my sins, let it multiply my fears and doubts. I will never fall in love again, but I
        think
        that I
        can do without...
        <br><br>
        In the end, it all comes down to what you need and what you have. In the end, it's like a joke that makes you
        wince
        when you should laugh. I guess it's sad to want somebody who will never want you back. In the end, it isn't
        living
        if
        you're living in the past.
        <br><br>
        I want what I want and I will take what you give... but now I'm walking back to my car, tired and lonely from
        guarding
        my heart. I want you to mean more, but I know what it meant...Now I am walking home, and I am walking alone.</p>
