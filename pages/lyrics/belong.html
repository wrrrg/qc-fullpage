    <h1 class="album-title">WE ARE ARE ALL WHERE WE BELONG (2011)</h1>

    <h2 class="song-title">THE CONFESSOR ( YOU COULD EXIST WITHOUT IT)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">The river's wide, that I could not swim across it, so I convinced myself I'd walked upon the
        waves, but I don't want to waste my life.I wanted to feel as saved as they do, but the more I live, the harder
        to believe that their god above knows the first thing about love or goes along with every rule they make up. I
        don't want to waste my life, thinking about the afterlife.</p>



    <h2 class="song-title">YOU, ME, & THE BOATMAN (TRUTH IS, I'VE BEEN THIRSTY MY WHOLE LIFE)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">Lover, won't you stay with me until the boatman comes for me and kindly carries me across
        the sea? May our legends live to tell how we burnt down Heaven and conquered Hell. But you and I should live
        forever, because you and I know how to live.
        <br><br>
        It's you and me. Our love is bigger than 'most everything. It stretched out further than our eyes could see
        when you gave your heart to me completely.
        <br><br>
        Oh, everybody knows what it looks like to be in love. Even the boatman knows it's so but he still has to do his
        job. I know it's tough, I know it sucks.
        <br><br>
        So lover won't you stay with me, til the boatman comes...
        <br><br>
        Because I don't care about the past or future, when this existence is probably all we have. And so the lives we
        make are all that matter, so let's live to love and love to live.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">PREACHING TO THE CHOIR INVISIBLE, PART I (WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE?)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">So you say you've got a peace about it? Well, I propose you could live without it, because
        we'd all love to invent the mystery, and we'd all love to deny the history, but love leads me on, lets me say
        what I think; That we all belong to the earth and the sea. You say the truth sets us free? Sounds good to me!
        <br><br>
        Open up the pit! He swallows or spits, and I swallowed that shit for so long. Now what should I think of faith?
        It
        ain't noble or brave, and I don't need to be saved or chosen. Love leads me on, lets me say what I think: That
        we
        all belong to the earth and the sea. You say the truth sets us free? Well, it calls to me and it offers no
        empty
        promises, because there's probably nothing more than this: "Just today."
        <br><br>
        So can you see that we are all where we belong?
    </p>


    <h2 class="song-title">SET YOUR MONSTER FREE(MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION IS TO COPE WITH MY MORALITY)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">Daughter, I once thought that I had angels in my room. They were sleeping on my fan while I
        was dreaming of you.
        And daughter, I once had such desire to believe that our lives had been planned out by an unseen deity, but you
        don't have to waste your time holding on to beautiful lies.
        <br><br>
        Daughter, I once knew that everything that I believed was good, and fair, and true, and consistent with my
        needs.
        But daughter, I am wrong almost as often as I'm right. So daughter, just be strong enough to make up your own
        mind,
        because you don't have to waste your time, holding on to beautiful lies.
    </p>


    <h2 class="song-title">WE WENT TO THE RENAISSANCE FAIR (...ALL OUR FRIENDS WERE THERE)</h2>
    <p class="song-lyrics">
        I'm on my best behavior and trying to avoid an early grave, but despite my best intentions, I'm bound to
        disappoint
        you either way. So do you love me? Can you love me? Because I think I will always be this way and I think I
        will
        always be afraid.
        <br><br>
        Love me with no reservations and I promise I'll be good. You are my salvation, so let's pretend there's angels
        singing, "Here's to you and healthy living! Take it easy." We make it easy. And I think that it's never gonna
        change, and I think we will always be this way.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">FEAR & FALLACY SITTING IN A TREE (YOU WERE DOING WELL UNTIL EVERYONE DIED)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">I tried a million times to understand it, and I thought I did. But at the bottom of this
        there is a panic, and I
        bought right in. But the problem with me and the problem with you is that we're all just so scared to die. But
        I
        know my time is coming.

        So let's bow our heads....for something, pray that god is on our side. But the pagan and the pious, they all
        sound
        the same, "Oh my god! Oh my god!" The problem with me and the problem with you, is that we're all just so
        scared to
        die. But I know my time is coming, I can't keep my time from coming.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">ARE YOU A MIRROR? (OR A WINDOW?)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">Oh little baby, you are fragile and weak, so I will hold you til you fall asleep. I look
        inside you and I see
        myself. I will love you, I will try and be strong, though, my bones are aching and my days are long. You'll
        look
        inside me and you'll see yourself, as I look inside you and I see myself.
        <br><br>
        And one day you will look me straight in my eyes and judge me for the things I've been in your life. I hope you
        love me when you know me well, because I look inside you and I see myself.
    </p>


    <h2 class="song-title">EVERYTHING LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE (XANADU CLAMBAKE, POINT ZION, RI, SUMMER 2001)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">Long, long ago (back when the ocean was our home), we crawled out of the sea, so eager to
        breathe. We looked to the
        sky, and to the limits of our minds, to understand why all things die, and how we came to be. Thought we knew
        all
        we'd need.
        <br><br>
        But it's time to get off our knees and offer our hands up to the earth. And it's time, to find where we belong
        and
        see what it's worth.
        <br><br>
        Don't lay me down, I don't ever want to die. I've had too good a time, I really like it here. But all those
        prophets promised me, that if I could just believe, eternal life and peace would be waiting for me. But when I
        go,
        there will probably be no angels singing, no harps ringing, no pearly gates, nor devil's flames, just nothing
        nothing nothing nothing. Wouldn't it be grand to take some comfort in those same holy texts that pacify my
        friends?
        Well, it wouldn't change the fact that all we know is we come and we go. So it goes, so it goes, so it goes.
        <br><br>
        Don't let me go, I'm not prepared. I'm so damned scared that I'm almost there.
    </p>


    <h2 class="song-title">THE BLACK SHEEP &THE SHEPHERD (LOOK, I'M JUST AN INSTRUMENT, OKAY?)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">The river's wide, that I could not swim across it, so I convinced myself I'd walked up on
        the waves. The river's
        wide, that I could not swim across it, so I told everyone I'd walked up on the waves.
        <br><br>
        But I lied, and I knew I'd lied, but I did everything I did to soothe the family pride and I just don't think I
        can
        keep it up now. Because I've never heard Jesus speak to me (not in any way that I'd consider speaking) but I
        bowed
        my head just the same. Though, I did find some tears when they played that song, but for the four right chords
        I
        will play along, I have always been that way. It doesn't matter what the lyrics say.
        <br><br>
        Into stronger arms we run, with a thorn in our side and the devil's inside. So who are we running from? Into
        stranger arms we run. Such a thorn in our side, when the devil's implied. Oh what have we done?
        <br><br>
        So I tried and I tried to achieve belief. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but I've been feeling fine
        (In
        fact, often better than fine.) Though, now both my shoulders have started hurting from walking around under
        such a
        burden, to reconcile everything that we learn with everything that we were taught. But with all we know now,
        how
        can you say "Oh you've just got to take it all on faith" and "Don't think too much. Just hush and pray, exactly
        as
        we've always done."
        <br><br>
        Hey god! Now I've got a baby girl. What am I supposed to tell her about you? Because her life shouldn't have to
        be
        like mine. She shouldn't have to waste her time on waiting on you, because you never do come through.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes I can't believe the things those preachers have the nerve to say to me, but maybe the things that I'd
        have to say to them are really just as bad. Because the only times I ever thought of suicide, I was waiting on
        the
        lord to direct my life, saying "give me one word and I'll put down the knife and I'll never pick it up again."
        But
        luckily I held out long enough to see that everybody really makes their own destiny. It's a beautiful thing.
        It's
        just you and me, exactly where we belong, and there's nothing inherently wrong with us.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">THE EASY CONFIDENCE(WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU NOW)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics"> I was screaming out your name. I guess you never heard me, but I was screaming it for
        years, and I think I deserve
        a reason for why you've been so elusive. Now I've been thinking about my life and I can't believe that I have
        wasted so much time trying to be what everyone loves, the prodigal son returning. Oh, what a sight, the
        prodigal
        son returning.
        <br><br>
        If Jesus Christ ever reached down and touched my life, he certainly left no sign to let me know he had. And I
        wouldn't mind that he couldn't find the time, it's just that now my heart longs for things that probably don't
        exist. But now I think I see this for what it is.
        <br><br>
        Oh my soul! Oh, my soul is tired, but I've got an itch to scratch, I've got a stone to throw, and I want to
        sink my
        teeth into your hollow bones. I've got a bone to pick, and I want to pick it clean! Oh, the prodigal son and
        his
        shameful disbelief.
        <br><br>
        I want something better. I want something real. And this is the part where my exit starts, because I caught a
        glimpse of the father's heart. Do we want something we can't have? So come on, friends, count up your sins: one
        for
        being human, two for being born like this. This isn't love. We're not in love. If you wanted love, you just
        should've spoken up.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">MIDNIGHT AT THE LAZARUS PIT (THE HARLOT AND THE BEAST ARE DATING!)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">
        I had a life of the spirit, now I've got a hang up on death. But I know what I want, I want a taste of the
        flesh. I
        looked at you and I saw it. I saw the light in your eyes and it filled up the room, it settled and grew.
        <br><br>
        I'm completely yours.
        <br><br>
        I tried to make myself perfect. I tried to make myself strong. And I walked in straight lines, hands by my
        sides.
        But you were the top of the mountain that I couldn't see from below, but I climbed towards the light, taking my
        time.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">PREACHING TO THE CHOIR INVISIBLE, PART II (WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN WE LIVE?)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">
        We filled a book with what Jesus said, so we could all disagree on what he meant to say. Do you know better
        than
        me? Well, if there's a chance the divine exists, I hope it can cure my soul of all of my sins, of all the
        things I
        did because I believed the myth.
        <br><br>
        I'll make a deal with Jesus Christ, speak just one word I can hear, prove your alive, and I'll believe you're
        here.
        Well, I may as well just admit the truth. I have rejected holier spirits than you, it's no big deal, halelujah.
        And
        you could exist without it, because it stands to reason that if there's not a god to comfort you, then there's
        not
        a god to punish you.
        <br><br>
        Hey kids, tell them what you really think. Think it over. This is your life, don't ignore it. This could be
        your
        only chance to repent so get of your knees and adore it, the responsibility of empathy. We are all where we
        belong.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS(THIS IS THE WORST CRAZY SECT I'VE EVER BEEN IN)</h2>

    <p class="song-lyrics">
        Time is on our side because it moves slow. We search through the shadows of our souls to try and tame the
        demons we
        control, and searching for a god we'll never know, when everybody's probably going to be alright.

    </p>

    <h2 class="song-title">AT LAST! THE CELESTIAL BEING SPEAKS (THE UTTERLY INDIFFERENT)</h2>
    <p class="song-lyrics"></p>
    God was hanging out where ever god does his hanging out, when he looked down at us through the clouds and said
    "What have I done?! I didn't mean to be so abstract, so elusive, you see. But I don't see why you should believe
    that you needed me, because you all belong to the earth that I placed you on. So lift up your heads, don't worry
    about death, you're all gonna be just fine."
    <br><br>
    Halelujah! We allbelong to the earth that we sprang up from. So lift up your heads, don't worry about death, we're
    all gonna be just fine.

    </p>
